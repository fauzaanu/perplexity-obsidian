# Workflow Plugin for Obsidian

Workflow is an obsidian plugin that allows you to create and run workflows with multiple tasks. Each task can be configured to use a different API provider and parameters. You can add as many tasks as you want to a workflow, and tasks are executed sequentially. The plugin is designed to be extendable, allowing you to integrate any API that follows the same specification as OpenAI.

## Supported API Providers
1. [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
2. [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai/)
3. 

## The idea of a workflow
Workflows are repeatable processes that can be automated. They are a series of steps that are executed sequentially to achieve a desired outcome. Perheps a sentence is formed with combining words, which can then be used to form a paragraph, which can then be used to form a chapter, which can then be used to form a book. Each step in this process is a task, and the entire process is a workflow. and this plugin allows you to automate this process.
