# Perplexity Obsidian

Totally experimental and personal plugin to make my workflow easier. Uses Perplexity API and OpenAI API to generate summaries, rewrites, and tags for notes. Hopefully more options are coming.

## Features:

1. **AI Assisted Research:** An icon is added to the left ribbon of the Obsidian workspace by this plugin. Upon clicking, you have the option to 'Research Current Note', 'Summarize Current Note', and 'Re-write Current Note', employing AI to enhance your note-taking process.

2. **Summarize, Rewrite, and Mine Data:** Using AI, you can summarize your notes, rewrite them, or extract key points from them with just a few clicks.

3. **Generates AI Tags:** It assists in generating meaningful tags from the text of your notes, adhering to the principles of the Cornell note-taking system.

4. **Constructs AI Titles:** The plugin is capable of generating the title for your notes.

To execute these tasks, the currently active note is used. If the text length exceeds a specific limit, only the last 4000 characters are employed. (not implemented yet, the code is there however)

## Installation:

This plugin is designed to work with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Place it into your plugins folder and enable it from the Obsidian setting menu to install it.

Before you use this plugin, be sure to have your Perplexity API key and OpenAI API key. These keys are required to be inputted in the plugin settings for it to work correctly.

## Summary:

Perplexity Obsidian, with its integration with Perplexity and OpenAI APIs, can bring out the maximum potential of your Obsidian notes. The plugin helps you to research, summarize and rewrite your notes, make them more concise, and well-structured, which ultimately brings you a more dynamic note-taking experience.
